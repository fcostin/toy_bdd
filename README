OVERVIEW:

a toy BDD implementation in python, based on Knuth's AoCP, Vol 4 Fascicle 1

TODO:

1. add scipt to generate Knuth-style BDD diagrams with graphviz
	impose ordering (variable tested must decrease)
	use dashed and solid for low, high branches
	use circles for branches and squares for sinks

2. implement algorithm R to reduce the horrific tree things connection.py generates
